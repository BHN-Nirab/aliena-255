Motivation

Many people have interest in space. They want to explore the space , visit it. But space traveling is not
easy and expensive also. As a result, many people loss their interest about space. Besides often people
don't find interest in reading large documents and stay deprived from a huge domain of knowledge about
space . So in the above situation, using NASA's vast resources we have created such an app which will
solve these problems.

Solution

Aliena 255 will use virtual reality where one will be able to explore, land, customize planets of the solar
system. We have developed 3D models of different elements of the solar system which inlcudes planets,
stars, asteroids. For this purpose we have used the data provided by NASA.
Overview Of APP
After starting the app the user will find himself on earth and more specifically in BANGLADESH.
Our robo-assistant Aliena will guide the user. The user will have to find his/her rocket which will
take him to the space. Now , after reaching the space he/she will be able to visit different planets
of solar system and he/she will be able to land on Earth and Mars.

How we are going to enhance knowledge?

Going near to a planet if the user focuses on that particular planet then all informations
of that planet such as radius, average temperature, velocity, distance from the sun etc will be
visible to the user. The users can change any of these attributes and inspect the changes of
other attributes for this change. Now, this will give clear knowledge to the users about the
characteristics of that planet and also the relation between the attributes.
Interaction
All controls will be to the user. Through motion controlling system the user can move his
own control and also various other aspects as well.
Now, for all this the user will just need a simple VR box. Thus ALIENA 255 will make you feel how it is
like in space.

Main features of ALIENA 255

=> Real life touch in Virtual Reality
=> Exploring planets of solar system
=> Landing on Mars and Earth
=> Planet customization

Development Phase

=> First the idea was chosen and our work domain was fixed
=> Data collection from different resources, mainly from NASA open data.
=> Analysing the data we developed the 3D models and implemented the whole project
through unity 3D game engine. All the scripts were written in c# programming language.
=>Further, testing was done using VR Z4 virtual reality glass. This device is chosen because of
its low cost.
